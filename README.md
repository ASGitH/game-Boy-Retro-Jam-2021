[Retro Jam 2021](https://asgith.github.io/game-boy-retro-jam-2021-page) A Game Boy demake/prototype of Bonanza Bros originally released for the Sega Genesis.
You can find the link to the submission on [itch.io](https://asernaio.itch.io/bonaza-bros-demake).

Some things I was really proud of making was the A.I for the Guard, looking around and then having this alert phase where he would chase you.

Latest Update:

* March 12th, 2021
  - The finishing touches, the player can shoot, look at him go!
  - Logic was created in order to handle the animation changes when the player's state changed (example: jumping -> moving, moving -> shooting and vice versa).
  - Artificial Intelligence was created for the guard. They will turn left/right and if the player is in view, they will move towards them.

## Miscellaneous

Tools used:

* Backgrounds/Sprites/Tiles - [Game Boy Map Builder & Game Boy Tile Designer](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/GBTD_GBMB)

* Developer Kit - [Game Boy Development Kit](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020)

* Emulator - [BGB GameBoy Emulator](http://bgb.bircd.org/)

## To Run it

To get it up and running, you'll need to have a emulator that can run Game Boy games. My preference is to use [BGB GameBoy Emulator](http://bgb.bircd.org/)

Once you have an emulator of choice, then:

* Download the .gb file from the [releases section](https://github.com/ASGitH/game-Boy-Action-Adventure-Template/releases/tag/build-00).

* Load up the .gb file and have fun!
